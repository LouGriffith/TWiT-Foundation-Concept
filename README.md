TWiT-Foundation-Concept
=======================

Concept site for TWiT using Foundation.

I wanted to learn Zurb's Foundation 4 and SASS at the same time. What better way to do this by working on a concept site. 

I thought I would take a stab at TWiT.tv. My favorite source for tech news including This Week In Tech and MacBreak Weekly. 

Follow along as I push my threshold of what is possible and hopefully design a great looking concept site in the process.
