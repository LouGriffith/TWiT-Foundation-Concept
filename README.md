TWiT-Foundation-Concept
=======================

## The Point

Concept site for TWiT using Foundation.

I wanted to learn <strong><a href="http://www.foundation.zurb.com">Zurb's Foundation 4</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.sass-lang.com/">SASS</a></strong> at the same time. What better way to do this by working on a concept site. 

I thought I would take a stab at <strong><a href="http://www.twit.tv">TWiT.tv</a></strong>. My favorite source for tech news including This Week In Tech and MacBreak Weekly. 

Follow along as I push my threshold of what is possible and hopefully design a great looking concept site in the process.
